# wh_censorify
You should really use this module because it is really pretty cool, I guess.
use .censore(str) to replace undesireable words with stars

use .getCensoredWords() to get an array of all the censored words

use .addCensroedWord( word ) to add a word you would like to censor

DEFAULT CENSORED WORDS:
	sad
	bad
	mad
i

Here are some words that probably don't need to be censored:
	Dog
	Pickle
	Saw
	Teeth
	White
	Clear
	Fify
